Local Food Donation Network is a Flutter-based mobile app designed to reduce food waste by connecting donors (like college canteens or restaurants) with nearby NGOs in need. Using Google technologies like Firebase and Google Maps, the app allows donors to quickly upload details and images of excess food, while NGOs can view and claim these donations in real-time. The prototype also simulates AI-powered matching (using Gemini API) and food expiry prediction (using Vertex AI) to make the distribution process smarter and safer. Our goal is to streamline food redistribution at the community level and make sure surplus food reaches the right hands on time.
